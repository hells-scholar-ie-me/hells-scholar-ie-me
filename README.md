## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Eli Holmes
## I am using the generic greeting because it was already there.

 I am interested in learning programming because I have a few ideas for apps that i would like to make, as well as be able to modify existing programs that i use frequently. ðŸ˜„ I am currently working on a recording projoect with a friend of mine who lives in KentuckyðŸ˜€. My favorite hobby is playing music and Magic the Gathering.  I have a recording studio at home, but i had to move recently so i am opperating on a condensed version of it.
